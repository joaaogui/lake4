# deX Setup Project

This is a base project to complete the first step of setting up the deX Platform. This will allow you to commit the scripts you create with deX to the dbt framework.

If you have a paid GitHub account, you can simply fork this repository and make it private. Otherwise, if your GitHub account is free, create an empty repository and commit the files in that repository.

Once you've created your repository, copy its URL and paste it into the deX Platform.
